# COCHomeless

Datasets and spatial tools for United States homelessness research.
`COCHomeless` packages HUD Continuum of Care (CoC) Point-in-Time (PIT)
homeless counts, CoC boundaries, a Census-to-CoC crosswalk, and
county-level homeless estimates, covering **2007–2025**.

## Installation

``` r

# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("SSDALab/COCHomeless", build_vignettes = TRUE)
library(COCHomeless)
```

`sf` is required (spatial objects). `tidycensus`, `ggplot2`, `tigris`,
`imputeTS` and a few others are only needed to rebuild data or run the
vignettes.

## Coverage

All series run **2007 through 2025** (annual). The 2025 PIT counts are
HUD’s official release; `hud2025_prelim` keeps the earlier Community
Solutions estimate for reference. In 2021 HUD waived the unsheltered
count for many CoCs during COVID-19, so 2021 understates homelessness —
the vignettes show an ARIMA reconstruction.

## Three forms of data

**1. CoC level (HUD administrative areas)**

| Object | What |
|----|----|
| `hud2007` … `hud2025` | PIT “Overall Homeless” count per CoC, by year |
| `coc2007` … `coc2025` | CoC boundary polygons (national `sf`), by year |
| `coc_mergers` | CoC merger crosswalk over time (code lineage) |
| `pit_us` | national totals split into sheltered / unsheltered |
| `pit_coc` | per-CoC sheltered / unsheltered / total, 2007–2025 |
| `pit_coc_detail` | per-CoC by shelter type × subpopulation (veterans, chronic, youth, families, gender, race, age) |
| `hud2025_prelim` | preliminary 2025 estimate (superseded by `hud2025`) |

CoC boundaries (`coc20XX`) also carry that year’s
`total`/`sheltered`/`unsheltered`.

**2. Census ↔︎ CoC crosswalk** (links Census tracts/counties to CoCs)

| Object | What |
|----|----|
| `tract_coc2007` … `tract_coc2025` | tract → CoC hard assignment, by year |
| `tract_coc_wt2007` … `tract_coc_wt2025` | tract ↔︎ CoC area weights, by year |
| `county_coc2007` … `county_coc2025` | county ↔︎ CoC weights (both directions), by year |

Tract geography uses 2010-census tracts for 2007–2019 and 2020-census
tracts for 2020–2025.

**3. County-level estimates** (CoC counts disaggregated to counties)

| Object | What |
|----|----|
| `homeless` | county estimates `count07`…`count25` + ACS covariates (imputed) |
| `homeless_na` | same, before imputation (missing counties as `NA`) |
| `sp_homeless` | `homeless` as `sf`, also carrying `sheltered<yy>`/`unsheltered<yy>` |
| `county_pit` | county sheltered / unsheltered / total, 2007–2025 (long) |
| `county_pit_detail` | county by shelter type × subpopulation (gender, race, age, …) |
| `counties`, `states` | full-US `sf` base layers |
| `area` | county land area (km²) |

## Vignettes

After installing with `build_vignettes = TRUE`:

``` r

browseVignettes("COCHomeless")
```

- **CoC Point-in-Time homeless counts** (`coc-pit-counts`) — national &
  state maps, per-CoC trends, sheltered/unsheltered series with ARIMA
  reconstruction of 2021.
- **County-level homeless estimates** (`county-estimates`) —
  county-vs-CoC comparison, per-capita maps, US/CA/WA trends, a 2025
  summary grid.
- **Census-to-CoC crosswalk** (`census-coc-crosswalk`) — using the
  crosswalk and `coc_mergers`.

Vignette sources are in
[`vignettes/`](https://ssdalab.github.io/COCHomeless/vignettes); build
scripts that regenerate every dataset from source are in
[`data-raw/`](https://ssdalab.github.io/COCHomeless/data-raw).

## Methodology & citation

County estimates disaggregate CoC PIT counts by population density and
impute counties with no CoC, following Almquist, Helwig & You (2020).

ACS pulls need a Census API key in `~/.Renviron` (`CENSUS_API_KEY`);
